Quick guide:

- "npm install" (on console) first on the project folder to install dependency, before doing development
- "npm run start" (on console) to enter development mode
- "npm run build" (on console) to make production files
- "dist" folder is production files, so use "dist" folder to install it on server
- "dev" folder is development files, nothing can do here just leave it as it is
- "src/views" folder is markup
- "src/styles" folder is css
- "src/scripts" folder is javascript
- "src/public" folder is static files (image, icon, etc)
- "src/fonts" folder is font files
- Also please keep in mind to purchase gsap license, because on the project files there it's using my license which is for developer not for business
